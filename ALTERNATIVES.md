# Alternatives to Avoid Bot Detection

## 1. Use Real Browser with Extensions
- Use Selenium with a real Chrome profile
- Control an actual Chrome instance (not Chromium)
- More resource intensive but less detectable

## 2. Browser Automation Services
- BrowserStack, LambdaTest (expensive)
- Browserless.io (managed Chrome)
- ScrapingBee, ScraperAPI (built for this)

## 3. Different Approach
- Use search APIs (Bing, SerpAPI, ScaleSerp)
- Build a hybrid: API for search, browser for specific sites
- Use residential proxies ($$$)

## 4. Manual Browser Control
- Use Chrome DevTools Protocol directly
- Control a real user's browser session
- Remote desktop automation

## The Reality
ChatGPT's "browser" likely:
- Uses Bing API (Microsoft partnership)
- Fetches specific pages server-side
- Never actually renders pages in a browser
- Has special IP arrangements

Your Playwright browser will always be somewhat detectable because it's designed for testing, not stealth browsing.
